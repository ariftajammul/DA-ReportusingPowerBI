Power Query is a data transformation and data preparation engine. Power Query comes with a graphical interface for getting data from sources and a Power Query Editor for applying transformations.

In Power Query, a column of text can be split into multiple columns and in several different ways to achieve the results you want. By default, the name of the new columns contains the same name as the original column with a suffix of a period (.) and a number that represents each split section from the original column.

When shaping data, a common task is to keep or remove duplicate rows. The results are based on which columns you select as the comparison to determine duplicate values is based on the data
